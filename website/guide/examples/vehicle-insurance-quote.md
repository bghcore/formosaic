# Vehicle Insurance Quote

A vehicle insurance quoting form with cascading vehicle selection, driver history, and computed premiums.

**Features demonstrated:**

- 3-level cascading dropdowns: vehicle type (car/truck/motorcycle) drives make options, make drives model options
- Three computed read-only premium fields via `$fn` value functions (monthly, annual, and coverage summary)
- High-risk surcharge warning via `and` condition: accidents > 2 AND premium coverage selected
- Commercial/rideshare usage notice shown via `or` condition with a `DynamicFragment` banner
- `not` operator for new customer discount banner (shown when `hasExistingPolicy` is false)
- Optional VIN field with conditional `pattern` validation (only validated when non-empty)
