# Expense Report

An expense report form with repeating line items, computed totals, and conditional approval.

**Features demonstrated:**

- Field array for expense line items (date, type, description, amount, receipt upload)
- Three computed read-only fields: subtotal via `$fn.sumExpenseItems()`, tax amount, and total (subtotal * tax rate)
- Business justification field auto-shown and required when the computed total exceeds $5,000
- Currency selector (USD/EUR) that dynamically updates the labels on subtotal, tax, and total fields
- Numeric range validation on line item amounts and tax rate
